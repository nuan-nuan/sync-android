# Cloudant Query - Android

Cloudant Query - Android is a Java implementation of [Cloudant Query][1] for Android mobile devices. It is included as part of the sync-core jar file.

Cloudant Query is inspired by MongoDB's query implementation, so users of MongoDB should feel at home using Cloudant Query in their mobile applications.

The aim is that the query you use on our cloud-based database works for your mobile application.

## Usage

These notes assume familiarity with Cloudant Sync Datastore.

Cloudant Query uses indexes explicitly defined over the fields in the document. Multiple indexes can be created for use in different queries, the same field may end up indexed in more than one index.

Query offers a powerful way to find documents within your datastore. There are a couple of restrictions on field names you need to be aware of before using query:

- A dollar sign (`$`) cannot be the first character of any field name.  This is because, when querying, a dollar sign tells the query engine to handle the object as a query operator and not a field.
- A field with a name that contains a period (`.`) cannot be indexed nor successfully queried.  This is because the query engine assumes dot notation refers to a sub-object.

These come from Query's MongoDB heritage where these characters are not allowed in field names, which we don't share. Hopefully we'll work around these restrictions in the future.

Querying is carried out by supplying a query in the form of a map which describes the query.

For the following examples, assume two things.

Firstly, we set up an `IndexManager` object, `im`, as follows:

```java
import com.cloudant.sync.datastore.DatastoreManager;
import com.cloudant.sync.datastore.Datastore;
import com.cloudant.sync.query.IndexManager;

File path = getApplicationContext().getDir("datastores");
DatastoreManager manager = new DatastoreManager(path.getAbsolutePath());
Datastore ds = manager.openDatastore("my_datastore");
IndexManager im = new IndexManager(ds);
```

The `IndexManager` object provides the ability to manage query indexes and execute queries.

Secondly, these documents are in the datastore:

```java
{ "name": "mike", 
  "age": 12, 
  "pet": {"species": "cat"},
  "comment": "Mike goes to middle school and likes reading books." };

{ "name": "mike", 
  "age": 34, 
  "pet": {"species": "dog"},
  "comment": "Mike is a doctor and likes reading books." };

{ "name": "fred", 
  "age": 23, 
  "pet": {"species": "cat"},
  "comment": "Fred works for a startup out of his home office." };
```

### Creating Indexes

In order to query documents, creating indexes over
the fields to be queried against will typically enhance query performance.  Currently we support two types of indexes.  The first, a JSON index, is used by query clauses containing comparison operators like `$eq`, `$lt`, and `$gt`.  Query clauses containing these operators are based on standard SQLite indexes to provide query results.  The second, a TEXT index, uses SQLite's full text search (FTS) engine.  A query clause containing a `$text` operator with a `$search` operator uses [SQLite FTS SQL syntax] [ftsHome] along with a TEXT index to provide query results.

Basic querying of fields benefits but does _not require_ a JSON index. For example, `{ "name" : { "$eq" : "mike" } }` would benefit from a JSON index on the `name` field but would succeed even if there isn't an index on `name`. Text queries, by contrast, _require_ an index. Therefore `{ "$text" : { "$search" : "doctor books" } }` would need a TEXT index on the `comment` field (based on the content of the above documents). A TEXT index is used to perform term searches, phrase searches and prefix searches (starts with... queries). Querying capabilities and syntax are covered later in this document.

[ftsHome]: http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#section_3



Use the following methods to create a JSON index:

```
ensureIndexed(List<Object> fieldNames, 
              String indexName)
```

Use either of the following methods to create a TEXT index:

```
ensureIndexed(List<Object> fieldNames, 
              String indexName, 
              String indexType)

// or 

ensureIndexed(List<Object> fieldNames, 
              String indexName, 
              String indexType, 
              Map<String, String> indexSettings)
``` 

These indexes are persistent across application restarts as they are saved to disk. They are kept up to date as documents change; there's no need to call the `ensureIndexed(...)` method each time your applications starts, though there is no harm in doing so.

The first argument, `fieldNames` is a list of fields to put into the index. The second argument, `indexName` is a name for the index. This is used to delete indexes at a later stage and appears when you list the indexes in the database.  The third argument, `indexType` defines what type of index to create.  Valid index types are `json` and `text`.  If not provided, the index type defaults to `json`.  The fourth argument, `indexSettings` is comprised of index parameters and their values.  Currently the only valid index setting is `tokenize` and it can only apply to a TEXT index.  If index settings are not provided for a TEXT index, the `tokenize` parameter defaults to the value `simple`.

A field can appear in more than one index. The query engine will select an appropriate index to use for a given query. However, the more indexes you have, the more disk space they will use and the greater the overhead in keeping them up to date.

To index values in sub-documents, use _dotted notation_. This notation puts the field names in the path to a particular value into a single string, separated by dots. Therefore, to index the `species` field of the `pet` sub-document in the examples above, use `pet.species`.

```java
// Create an index over the name, age, and species fields.
String name = im.ensureIndexed(Arrays.<Object>asList("name", "age", "pet.species"), 
                               "basic");
if (name == null) {
    // there was an error creating the index
}
```

####Indexing for text search

Since text search relies on SQLite FTS which is a compile time option, we must ensure that SQLite FTS is infact available.  To verify that text search is enabled and that a text index can be created use `isTextSearchEnabled()` before attempting to create a text index.  If text search is not enabled see [compiling and enabling SQLite FTS][enableFTS] and [SQLite Android Bindings][androidBind] for details. 

[enableFTS]: http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#section_2
[androidBind]: https://www.sqlite.org/android/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki

```java
if (im.isTextSearchEnabled()) {
    // Create a text index over the name and comment fields.
    String name = im.ensureIndexed(Arrays.<Object>asList("name", "comment"), 
                                   "basic_text_index", 
                                   "text");
    if (name == null) {
        // there was an error creating the index
    }
}
```

As text indexing relies on SQLite FTS functionality any custom tokenizers need to be managed through SQLite.  SQLite comes standard with the "simple" default tokenizer as well as a Porter stemming algorithm tokenizer ("porter").  Please refer to [SQLite FTS tokenizers][fts] for additional information on custom tokenizers.

[fts]: http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#tokenizer  

When creating a text index, overriding the default tokenizer setting is done by providing a `tokenize` parameter setting as part of the index settings.  The value should be the same as the tokenizer name given to SQLite when registering that tokenizer.  In the example below we set the tokenizer to `porter`.

```java
if (im.isTextSearchEnabled()) {
    Map<String, String> settings = new HashMap<String, String>();
    settings.add("tokenize", "porter");
    // Create a text index over the name and comment fields.
    String name = im.ensureIndexed(Arrays.<Object>asList("name", "comment"), 
                                   "basic_text_index", 
                                   "text",
                                   settings);
    if (name == null) {
        // there was an error creating the index
    }
}
```

The `ensureIndexed(...)` methods return the name of the index if it is successful, otherwise they return `null`.

##### Restrictions

- There is a limit of one text index per datastore.
- Text indexes cannot be created on field names containing an `=` sign. This is due to restrictions imposed by SQLite's virtual table syntax.

####Changing and removing indexes

If an index needs to be changed, first delete the existing index by calling `deleteIndexNamed(String indexName)` where the argument is the index name, then call the appropriate `ensureIndexed(...)` method with the new definition.

#### Indexing document metadata (_id and _rev)

The document ID and revision ID are automatically indexed under `_id` and `_rev` 
respectively. If you need to query on document ID or document revision ID,
use these field names.

#### Indexing array fields

Indexing of array fields is supported. See "Array fields" below for the indexing and
querying semantics.

### Querying syntax

Query documents are `Map` objects that use the [Cloudant Query `selector`][sel]
syntax. Several features of Cloudant Query are not yet supported in this implementation.
See below for more details.

[sel]: https://docs.cloudant.com/api/cloudant-query.html#selector-syntax

#### Equality and comparisons

To query for all documents where `pet.species` is `cat`:

```java
// query: { "pet.species": "cat" }
Map<String, Object> query = new HashMap<String, Object>();
query.put("pet.species", "cat");
```

If you don't specify a condition for the clause, equality (`$eq`) is used. To use other conditions, supply them explicitly in the clause.

To query for documents where `age` is greater than twelve use the `$gt` condition:

```java
// query: { "age": { "$gt": 12 } }
Map<String, Object> query = new HashMap<String, Object>();
Map<String, Object> gt12 = new HashMap<String, Object>();
gt12.put("$gt", 12);
query.put("age", gt12);
```

See below for supported operators (Selections -> Conditions).

#### Modulo operation in queries

Using the `$mod` operator in queries allows you to select documents based on the value of a field divided by an integer yielding a specific remainder.

To query for documents where `age` divided by 5 has a remainder of  4, do the following:

```java
{ "age": { "$mod": [ 5, 4 ] } }
```

A few things to keep in mind when using `$mod` are:

- The list argument to the `$mod` operator must contain two number elements. The first element is the divisor and the second element is the remainder.
- Division by zero is not allowed so the divisor cannot be zero.
- The dividend (field value), divisor, and the remainder can be positive or negative.
- The dividend, divisor, and the remainder can be represented as whole numbers or by using decimal notation.  However internally, prior to performing the modulo arithmetic operation, all three are truncated to their logical whole number representations.  So, for example, the query `{ "age": { "$mod": [ 5.6, 4.2 ] } }` will provide the same result as the query `{ "age": { "$mod": [ 5, 4 ] } }`.

#### Text search

After creating a text index, a text clause may be used as part of a query to perform full text search term matching, phrase matching, and prefix matching.  A text clause can stand on its own as a query or can be part of a compound query (see below).  Text search supports either SQLite [Standard Query Syntax][ftsStandard] or [Enhanced Query Syntax][ftsEnhanced].  This is dependent on which syntax is enabled as part of SQLite FTS.  Typically SQLite FTS on Android comes configured with the SQLite Standard Query Syntax (confirmed during testing on Android API levels 19, 20, and 21).  See [SQLite full text query][ftsQuery] for more details on syntax that is possible with text search.

[ftsQuery]: http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#section_3
[ftsStandard]: http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#section_3_1
[ftsEnhanced]: http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#section_3_2

##### Restrictions

- Only one text clause per query is permitted.
- All clauses in a query must be satisfied by an index if that query contains a text search clause.
- Both tokenizers, `simple` and `porter`, that come with text search by default are case-insensitive.

To find documents that include all of the terms in `doctor books` use:

```java         
// query: { "$text" : { "$search" : "doctor books" } }
Map<String, Object> query = new HashMap<String, Object>();
Map<String, Object> search = new HashMap<String, Object>();
search.put("$search", "doctor books");
query.put("$text", search);
```

This query will match the following document because both `doctor` and `books` are found in its comment field.

```
{ "name": "mike", 
  "age": 34, 
  "pet": {"species": "dog"},
  "comment": "Mike is a doctor and likes reading books." };
```

To find documents that include the phrase `is a doctor` use:

```java  
// query: { "$text" : { "$search" : "\"is a doctor\"" } }
Map<String, Object> query = new HashMap<String, Object>();
Map<String, Object> search = new HashMap<String, Object>();
search.put("$search", "\"is a doctor\"");
query.put("$text", search);
```

This query will match the following document because the phrase `is a doctor` is found in its comment field.

```
{ "name": "mike", 
  "age": 34, 
  "pet": {"species": "dog"},
  "comment": "Mike is a doctor and likes reading books." };
```

To find documents that include the prefix `doc` use:

```java              
// query: { "$text" : { "$search" : "doc*" } }
Map<String, Object> query = new HashMap<String, Object>();
Map<String, Object> search = new HashMap<String, Object>();
search.put("$search", "doc*");
query.put("$text", search);
```

This query will match the following document because the prefix `doc` followed by the `*` wildcard matches `doctor` found in its comment field.

```
{ "name": "mike", 
  "age": 34, 
  "pet": {"species": "dog"},
  "comment": "Mike is a doctor and likes reading books." };
```

These examples are a small sample of what can be done using text search.  Take a look at the [SQLite full text query][ftsQuery] documentation for more details.

#### Compound queries

Compound queries allow selection of documents based on more than one criteria.  If you specify several clauses, they are implicitly joined by AND.

To find all people named `fred` with a `cat` use:

```java
// query: { "name": "fred", "pet.species": "cat" }
Map<String, Object> query = new HashMap<String, Object>();
query.put("name", "fred");
query.put("pet.species", "cat");
```

##### Using OR to join clauses

Use `$or` to find documents where just one of the clauses match.

To find all people with a `dog` who are under thirty:

```java
// query: { "$or": [ { "pet.species": { "$eq": "dog" } }, 
//                   { "age": { "$lt": 30 } }
//                 ]}
Map<String, Object> query = new HashMap<String, Object>();
Map<String, Object> petClause = new HashMap<String, Object>();
Map<String, Object> eqDog = new HashMap<String, Object>();
eqDog.put("$eq", "dog");
petClause.put("pet.species", eqDog);
Map<String, Object> ageClause = new HashMap<String, Object>();
Map<String, Object> lt30 = new HashMap<String, Object>();
lt30.put("$lt", 30);
ageClause.put("age", lt30);
query.put("$or", Arrays.<Object>asList(eqDog, lt30));
```

#### Using AND and OR in queries

Using a combination of AND and OR allows the specification of complex queries.

This selects documents where _either_ the person has a pet `dog` _or_ they are
both over thirty _and_ named `mike`:

```java
// query: { "$or": [ { "pet.species": { "$eq": "dog" } }, 
//                   { "$and": [ { "age": { "$gt": 30 } },
//                               { "name": { "$eq": "mike" } }
//                             ] }
//                 ]}
Map<String, Object> query = new HashMap<String, Object>();
Map<String, Object> petClause = new HashMap<String, Object>();
Map<String, Object> eqDog = new HashMap<String, Object>();
eqDog.put("$eq", "dog");
petClause.put("pet.species", eqDog);
Map<String, Object> andClause = new HashMap<String, Object>();
Map<String, Object> ageClause = new HashMap<String, Object>();
Map<String, Object> nameClause = new HashMap<String, Object>();
Map<String, Object> gt30 = new HashMap<String, Object>();
gt30.put("$gt", 30);
ageClause.put("age", gt30);
Map<String, Object> eqMike = new HashMap<String, Object>();
eqMike.put("$eq", "mike");
nameClause.put("name", eqMike);
andClause.put("$and", Arrays.<Object>asList(ageClause, nameClause));
query.put("$or", Arrays.<Object>asList(petClause, andClause));
```

### Executing queries

To find documents matching a query, use the `IndexManager` object's `find(Map<String, Object> query)` method. This returns an object that can be used in `for ( : )` loops to enumerate over the results.

```java
QueryResult result = im.find(query);
for (DocumentRevision rev : result) {
    // The returned revision object contains all fields for
    // the object. You cannot project certain fields in the
    // current implementation.
}
```

There is an extended version of the `find` method which supports:

- Sorting results.
- Projecting fields from documents rather than returning whole documents.
- Skipping results.
- Limiting the number of results returned.

For any of these, use 

```java
find(Map<String, Object> query,
     long skip,
     long limit,
     List<String> fields,
     List<Map<String, String>> sortDocument)
```

#### Sorting

Provide a sort document to the extended version of the `find` method to sort the results of a query. 

The sort document is a list of fields to sort by. Each field is represented by a map specifying the name of the field to sort by and the direction to sort.

The sort document must use fields from a single index.

As yet, you can't leave out the sort direction. The sort direction can be `asc` (ascending) or `desc` (descending).

```java
// sort document: [ { "name": "asc" },
//                  { "age": "desc" } ]
List<Map<String, String>> sortDocument = new ArrayList<Map<String, String>>();
Map<String, String> sortByName = new HashMap<String, String>();
Map<String, String> sortByAge = new HashMap<String, String>();
sortByName.put("name", "asc");
sortByAge.put("age", "desc");
sortDocument.add(sortName);
sortDocument.add(sortAge);
QueryResult queryResult = im.find(query, 0, 0, null, sortDocument);
```

Pass `null` as the `sort` argument to disable sorting.

#### Projecting fields

Projecting fields is useful when you have a large document and only need to use a
subset of the fields for a given view.

To project certain fields from the documents included in the results, pass a list of field names to the `fields` argument. These field names:

- Must be top level fields in the document.
- Cannot use dotted notation to access sub-documents.

For example, in the following document the `name`, `age` and `pet` fields could be projected, but the `species` field inside `pet` cannot:

```json
{
    "name": "mike",
    "age": 12,
    "pet": { "species": "cat" }
}
```

To project the `name` and `age` fields of the above document:

```java
List<String> fields = Arrays.asList("name", "age");
QueryResult queryResult = im.find(query, 0, 0, fields, null);
```

Pass `null` as the `fields` argument to disable projection.

#### Skip and limit

Skip and limit allow retrieving subsets of the results. Amongst other things, this is useful in pagination.

* `skip` skips over a number of results from the result set.
* `limit` defines the maximum number of results to return for the query.

To display the twenty-first to thirtieth results:

```java
QueryResult result = im.find(query, 20, 10, fields, null);
```

To disable:

- `skip`, pass `0` as the `skip` argument.
- `limit`, pass `0` as the `limit` argument.

### Array fields

Indexing and querying over array fields is supported in Cloudant Query Android, with some caveats.

Take this document as an example:

```
{
  _id: mike32
  pet: [ cat, dog, parrot ],
  name: mike,
  age: 32
}
```

You can create an index over the `pet` field:

```java
String name = im.ensureIndexed(Arrays.<Object>asList("name", "age", "pet"), 
                               "basic");
```

Each value of the array is treated as a separate entry in the index. This means that a query such as:

```
{ pet: { $eq: cat } }
```

Will return the document `mike32`. Negation such as:

```
{ pet: { $not: { $eq: cat } } }
```

Will not return `mike32` because negation returns the set of documents that are not in the set of documents returned by the non-negated query.  In other words the negated query above will return all of the documents that are not in the set of documents returned by `{ pet: { $eq: cat } }`.

#### Restrictions

Only one field in a given index may be an array. This is because each entry in each array
requires an entry in the index, causing a Cartesian explosion in index size. Taking the
above example, this document wouldn't be indexed because the `name` and `pet` fields are
both indexed in a single index:


```
{
  _id: mike32
  pet: [ cat, dog, parrot ],
  name: [ mike, rhodes ],
  age: 32
}
```

If this happens, an error will be emitted into the log but the indexing process will be
successful.

However, if there was one index with `pet` in and another with `name` in, like this:

```java
String indexOne = im.ensureIndexed(Arrays.<Object>asList("name", "age"), 
                                   "index_one");
String indexTwo = im.ensureIndexed(Arrays.<Object>asList("age", "pet"),
                                   "index_two");
```

The document _would_ be indexed in both of these indexes: each index only contains one of
the array fields.

Also see "Unsupported features", below.


### Errors

Error reporting is somewhat lacking right now. Presently a `null` return value from the `find` methods or the `ensureIndexed(List<Object> fieldNames, String indexName)` method indicates that something went wrong. Any errors that are encountered are logged but exceptions are not thrown as of yet.

## Grammar

To help, I've tried to write a grammar/schema for the Query language.

Here:

* Bold is used for the JSON formatting (or to indicate the representation of the use of Map, List etc. in Java).
* Italic is variables in the grammar-like thing.
* Quotes enclose literal string values.
