 * <p>A single revision of a document within a datastore.</p>

 * <p>Documents within the datastore are in fact trees of document revisions,
 * with one document marked as the current winner at any point. Branches in
 * the tree are caused when a document is edited in more than one place before
 * being replicated between datastores. The consuming application is responsible
 * for finding active branches (also called conflicts), and marking the leaf
 * nodes of all branches but one deleted (thereby resolving the conflict).</p>
 *
 * <p>A {@code DocumentRevision} contains all the information for a single document
 * revision, including its ID and revision ID, along with the document's
 * content for this revision as a {@link DocumentBody} object. Clients will
 * typically set only the revision content rather than the metadata
 * explicitly.</p>
